        <p>
          Hello! My name is Anbo Huang, a 3A Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.
          I enjoy building projects that combine creativity and technical problem-solving.
          <br /><br />
          I have experience in C++, Java, Python, and Unity, with projects ranging from
          a GUI-based chess game to financial data backtesting systems.
          <br /><br />
          Currently, I am interning at CCB Fintech in Shanghai, working on developing
          bank-enterprise direct-connect interfaces for electronic commercial drafts.
          <br /><br />
          Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring design, traveling, and playing video games (especially League of Legends).

      <div class="resume-body">
        <p>
          Outside of academics and professional work, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me both active and creative. 
          I love <strong>hiking</strong> and <strong>traveling</strong>, as they allow me to explore new places, challenge myself physically, and appreciate nature. 
          I also regularly play <strong>Frisbee</strong>, which has helped me develop teamwork, quick decision-making, and a strong sense of community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy playing <strong>video games</strong>, especially strategy and multiplayer games that combine problem-solving with collaboration. 
          Beyond recreation, I like to spend time <strong>exploring algorithms</strong> and <strong>writing programs</strong> that solve interesting problems or automate tasks. 
          These personal projects allow me to experiment freely, stay curious, and continuously improve my programming skills.

      <div class="resume-body">
        <p>
          I grew up in Shanghai in a warm and supportive family, where I was fortunate to have a happy and memorable childhood. 
          During school holidays, my parents would often take our family on trips to different places. My father always said that he wanted me to explore the world while I was young, so I could grow up with curiosity and wonderful memories. 
          These early experiences taught me to appreciate adventure, discovery, and the beauty of new environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have an older brother who is five years ahead of me. As kids, we fought constantly—he always had the upper hand, but that never stopped me from challenging him with all my might. 
          Looking back, those playful quarrels were a big part of our bond. Despite the teasing, we have always been very close, and he remains one of the most influential people in my life. 
          When he went to Canada for high school, I would hear stories about his experiences abroad, which inspired me to follow a similar path in my own studies.

    <details class="collapse lol main-container" id ="league">
      <summary class="about-title">League of Legends</summary>
      <div class="resume-body">
        <p>
          I began playing League of Legends during my early high school years, initially under the in-game name 
          <strong>caomeieeer</strong>, and later also as <strong>HAB</strong>. 
          What started as a casual interest quickly grew into a long-term passion. 
          The game’s unique combination of strategic depth, mechanical skill, and teamwork fascinated me, and I dedicated countless hours to improving both individually and with friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I steadily climbed the ranked ladder across multiple servers. 
          On the Chinese super server, which is widely regarded as the most competitive environment in the world, I reached <strong>Grandmaster</strong> with over 800 LP, facing and learning from professional players on a regular basis. 
          In North America, I pushed even further, peaking at <strong>Challenger 1249LP</strong> in solo queue. 
          Reaching those heights required discipline, resilience, and the ability to constantly adapt my playstyle against the strongest opponents.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey through different roles also shaped the way I view the game. 
          I began as an <strong>ADC</strong>, mastering the fundamentals of positioning, map awareness, and late-game consistency. 
          Later, I transitioned to <strong>support</strong>, where I learned the importance of vision control, communication, and empowering teammates. 
          Eventually, I found a long-term home in the <strong>mid lane</strong>, a role that demands both mechanical sharpness and an ability to impact the entire map. 
          Each role change not only broadened my understanding of the game but also taught me how to be flexible and see challenges from multiple perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond ranked play, I frequently participated in online tournaments and community events with friends, building a sense of camaraderie and gaining first-hand experience in competitive team environments. 
          These matches emphasized leadership, coordination, and trust — skills that extend well beyond the game itself. 
          They also gave me a small taste of the professional scene I had admired growing up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, although my main focus is on academics and pursuing Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, League of Legends remains an important part of my story. 
          It has not only provided me with unforgettable memories but also taught me enduring lessons in perseverance, adaptability, and teamwork. 
          I continue to play from time to time under my IDs <strong>caomeieeer</strong> and <strong>HAB</strong>, carrying forward the mindset that helped me reach my peak in the game into the challenges I take on in life.
